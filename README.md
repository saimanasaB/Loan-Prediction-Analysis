# Loan Prediction analysis
Language and dataset : Python and customerdetails.csv

In the above project, a comprehensive analysis and modeling process is conducted on a dataset related to loan approval predictions. The initial steps involve loading the training and testing data, examining the structure and types of the data, and identifying any missing values. Various strategies are employed to handle these missing values, such as forward-filling and using the median or mode of the columns. This ensures the dataset is complete and suitable for further analysis. Visualizations, including bar charts and scatter plots, are used to explore the distribution of categorical variables and the relationships between numerical variables, providing insights into the data’s structure and potential predictors of loan approval status.

Following data cleaning and exploration, the project proceeds with encoding categorical variables into numerical formats using label encoding. This step is crucial for preparing the data for machine learning algorithms, which typically require numerical input. Correlation matrices and heatmaps are generated to understand the relationships between different features, aiding in the selection of relevant predictors for the modeling phase. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and various classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, are applied to predict the loan approval status. Each model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, allowing for a comparison of their effectiveness.

The analysis reveals that the Logistic Regression model achieves the highest accuracy (approximately 84%) and demonstrates strong performance metrics across the board, indicating it is the most effective model for this dataset. The project concludes by refining the feature set and further validating the model to ensure robustness. The final dataset includes only the most relevant features, and the project’s insights highlight the relationships and importance of various features in predicting loan approval, offering a practical approach for similar financial predictive modeling tasks.
